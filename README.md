# Learning Journal  

This week, I explored how to work with the DOM.

- `getElementById`  
- `querySelector`  
- `querySelectorAll`  

### Summary  
I learned how to use these methods to select and manipulate HTML elements dynamically through JavaScript.<br>
By working with the DOM, I was able to modify content, update styles, and interact with elements more efficiently.
